# Introduction:
The purpose of this milestone report is to indicate that I am sufficiently capable of handling large data sets within the R framework. The data set that I will use is a corpus of curated text from various blogs, news sites, and twitter posts, or 'tweets'. I will apply this data set to a text prediction algorithim which will be compiled into a Shiny application in the second half of the course.

The remaining sections of this report will explain how I download, extract, clean, and analyze the data required for the text prediction app which I will present at the end of the course.
